## About Me
Iâ€™m Arya, an AIT student currently pursuing my **BE in Electronics and Communication Engineering (ECE)**.  
I love traveling, playing volleyball, and reading books.  

I also enjoy working with technology and have basic knowledge of **Python** and **MySQL**.  
This portfolio is a simple place where Iâ€™ll be sharing my projects and progress.
